# BaseNTableRM

BaseNTableRM is a lightweight Ruby object relational mapping (ORM) library that is based on Rails' ActiveRecord. It translates rows from a SqLite3 database into Ruby objects  while maintaining readability and DRYness of your code. 

It incorporates metaprogramming techniques, and allows you to perform database operations in an object-oriented manner without having to write SQL code!

## Features and Implementation 

   * Implements the core functionality of ActiveRecord::Base.
   * Follows Ruby's 'convention over configuration' paradigm.
   * Utilizes SQLite3 and ActiveSupport::Inflector library.
